# Exploratory Data Analysis on Insurance Data

An exploratory data analysis on a sample insurance data, where I performed data cleaning, transformation, analysis and visualization.

I shared meaningful insights about the data, the trends and observations, and also added comments to help readers understand better.

This was programmed in R language and aims at contributing to learning. My next release on this data would be to build predictive and risk assessment models and also create visualization in Power BI.
